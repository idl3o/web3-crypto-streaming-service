## Architecture Overview

The Web3 Crypto Streaming Service uses a hybrid architecture combining traditional web technologies with blockchain components:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js application with responsive design
- **Backend Services**: Node.js microservices for content management and streaming
- **Blockchain Layer**: Ethereum and Bitcoin integrations for payments and ownership
- **IPFS Integration**: For decentralized content storage and retrieval
- **Smart Contracts**: Managing content rights, payments, and subscriptions

## Core Components

### Connection Manager

The Connection Manager handles blockchain network connections with fallback and retry capabilities. It supports multiple networks (Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, local development chains) and automatically reconnects when connections fail.

```typescript
// Example: Getting a blockchain provider with automatic fallback
import { connectionManager } from '@/services/ConnectionManagerService';

const provider = await connectionManager.getProvider('mainnet');
const blockNumber = await provider.getBlockNumber();
```

### Transaction Retry Service

The Transaction Retry Service handles failed blockchain transactions with configurable retry strategies. This ensures that network issues don't result in lost transactions.

```typescript
// Example: Creating a retryable transaction
import { transactionRetryService } from '@/services/TransactionRetryService';

await transactionRetryService.scheduleTransaction({
  id: 'payment-123',
  type: 'payment',
  method: 'sendTransaction',
  params: [{ to: receiverAddress, value: paymentAmount }],
  service: 'paymentService'
});
```

### Morning Stats Service

Provides real-time blockchain market information for the "gm" greeting feature, showing Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, market trends, and network stats.

## Blockchain Integration

### Multi-Chain Support

The platform supports multiple blockchains:

- **Ethereum**: For smart contracts, NFTs, and ERC-20 token payments
- **Polygon**: For lower-fee alternatives to Ethereum
- **Bitcoin**: For traditional cryptocurrency payments

### Bitcoin Integration

The service includes comprehensive Bitcoin payment processing with:

- Address validation and display utilities
- QR code generation for payments
- Multiple address formats (Legacy, SegWit, Taproot)
- Transaction management and verification

## Network Management

The MyConnectionNetwork component enables users to:

- View and manage blockchain connections
- Monitor connection health and performance
- Add custom networks
- Switch between networks with automatic fallback

## Payment Systems

### Crypto Payments

Support for multiple payment methods:

- Direct Bitcoin transfers
- Ethereum transactions
- ERC-20 token payments
- NFT-based subscriptions

### Streaming Payments

Real-time micropayments based on streaming duration, enabling pay-as-you-watch models.

## User Authentication

### Web3 Authentication

- Wallet-based authentication using MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.
- Sign-message proof of ownership
- Session management

### Social Authentication

Integration with social platforms:

- VK (VKontakte) authentication
- Profile data synchronization

## AI Features

### Gemini AI Integration

The platform integrates Google's Gemini AI for:

- Content analysis and moderation
- Personalized recommendations
- Creator tools and suggestions
- Market insights and trend analysis

```typescript
// Example: Analyzing content with Gemini AI
import { geminiAIService } from '@/services/GeminiAIService';

const analysis = await geminiAIService.analyzeContent(
  videoDescription,
  'sentiment'
);
```

## Cross-Platform Support

### Mobile Support

- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Native mobile wrappers using Capacitor
- iOS-specific optimization
- Android compatibility

### System Information

The platform detects and adapts to different operating systems and environments:

- Custom optimizations for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android
- Automatic resource allocation based on device capabilities
- Path normalization across different OS environments

## Social Integration

- Authentication with VK accounts
- Content sharing to VK users
- Friend discovery and social graph integration

### Sharing Capabilities

- Cross-platform content sharing
- Deep linking to streams and content
- Social engagement tracking

## Regional Compliance

### USA Compliance

The platform implements USA-specific regulations:

- KYC requirements for transactions over $3,000
- Tax reporting and documentation (1099-K, W-9)
- Region-specific disclosures
- AML compliance measures

### Tax Reporting

Automated tax documentation and reporting tools for creators and users:

- Earnings tracking and calculation
- Tax form generation
- TIN/SSN validation and secure storage

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

When adding new features, consider these aspects:

1. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Ensure features work across all supported blockchains
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper retry mechanisms for blockchain operations
3. **Regional Compliance**: Check if the feature has region-specific requirements
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on different device form factors

### Testing

- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Integration tests for blockchain interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
