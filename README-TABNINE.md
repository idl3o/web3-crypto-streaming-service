# TabNine Integration Guide

This project uses TabNine for AI-powered code completion. This guide explains how to set up and use TabNine effectively with our Web3 Crypto Streaming Service codebase.

## Installation

1. **Install TabNine Extension**:
   - VS Code: [TabNine AI Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode)
   - JetBrains IDEs: [TabNine AI Code Completion](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12798-tabnine-ai-code-completion)

2. **Sign In to TabNine**: 
   - Open VS Code/your IDE
   - Click on the TabNine icon in the sidebar
   - Click "Sign In" and follow the authentication steps

3. **Project Configuration**:
   - This project includes a `.tabnine.json` configuration file that optimizes TabNine for our codebase
   - No additional setup is required after installing the extension

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Completions

TabNine will suggest code completions based on our project's common patterns:
- Service class methods (`SonaStreamingService`, `MituSaxService`, etc.)
- Component patterns for Vue components
- TypeScript interface implementations
- Error handling patterns

### 2. Import Suggestions

TabNine will automatically suggest imports for:
- Project services
- Components
- Utilities
- External libraries

### 3. Team Learning

TabNine learns from our codebase to provide increasingly relevant suggestions:
- Service interaction patterns
- Error handling patterns
- Component composition
- Blockchain integration code

## Best Practices

1. **Complete Function Bodies**:
   Let TabNine suggest complete function implementations when it recognizes patterns

2. **Accept Method Chains**:
   TabNine will learn common method chaining patterns for our services

3. **Documentation Generation**:
   Use TabNine to help generate consistent JSDoc comments

4. **Use TabNine Chat**:
   For complex code questions, use TabNine Chat by typing `//chat` in your editor
