The platform integrates with multiple cryptocurrency payment systems and employs advanced cryptographic protocols to ensure content protection and user privacy.

## Technologies & Skills
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, TypeScript, HTML5/CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (ENS integration), Bitcoin, Dogecoin
- **Security**: Quantum-resistant encryption, SNE Protocol, CCK2M system
- **Streaming**: HLS, DASH, P2P protocols
- **DevOps**: Docker, CI/CD pipelines, PowerShell automation
- **Testing**: Jest, Mocha, Integration testing

## Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Security Architecture
- Designed and implemented multi-layered security system using composite cipher approaches
- Created quantum-resistant encryption methods for future-proof data protection
- Developed token-based authentication with verification chains

### Multi-Cryptocurrency Payment Integration
- Integrated Bitcoin and Dogecoin payment networks with automatic retry capabilities
- Implemented micropayment systems allowing per-second content consumption billing
- Developed transaction verification systems with multi-signature security

### Decentralized Streaming Infrastructure
- Created proxy-based secure streaming with multiple encryption levels

- Implemented multi-device streaming with HomePod and Sonos integration

### Philosophical Content System
- Developed the Dionysian Agent for delivering philosophical audio content
- Created content categorization and adaptive playback systems
- Implemented metrics tracking for content engagement analysis

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Service Design
The system uses a comprehensive service-oriented architecture with clear boundaries between components:

- **Core Services**: Authentication, streaming, payment processing
- **Security Services**: Encryption, token verification, secure proxying
- **Utility Services**: Resource management, health monitoring, error handling

### Advanced Security Implementation
Multiple security layers provide defense-in-depth protection:

- **SNE Protocol**: End-to-end encryption for streaming content
- **POE Stream Crypto Token Protocol**: Secure token operations for content access
- **Lyigvas System**: Quantum-resistant security layer with matrix-based verification

## Challenges & Solutions
