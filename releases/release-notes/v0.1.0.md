# Release Notes - v0.1.0

## Release Date: May 15, 2024

## Overview

This is the initial release of the Web3 Crypto Streaming Service, featuring the core functionality for proof of existence and energy validation.

## Features

### Proof of Existence (PoE) Ecosystem
- Temporal hash generation using SHA-256 and precise microsecond timestamps
- Quantum-inspired state measurements for content verification
- Confidence level calculation based on quantum properties
- Smart contract integration for on-chain verification

### Energy Validation
- Energy signature calculation based on content properties
- Multiple entropy measurement algorithms (Shannon, conditional, Kolmogorov, spectral)
- Efficiency calculation for validation quality assessment
- Different precision levels (low, medium, high)

### Smart Contract
- On-chain proof registration and verification
- Quantum signature storage
- Confidence level tracking
- Event emission for proof registration and verification

### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation on the PoE ecosystem
- Technical specifications and implementation details
- Future roadmap and development plans

## Installation

```bash
npm install web3-crypto-streaming-service
```

## Usage

See the [README.md](../../README.md) for usage instructions.

## Known Issues

- High entropy calculation can be CPU intensive for large files
- Smart contract has not been audited for production use
- Limited browser support for some cryptographic functions

## What's Next

Our next release will focus on:
- Cross-chain validation support
- Zero-knowledge proof integration
- Performance improvements for large files
